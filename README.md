# Basic Memory Uberspace

Run your own [Basic Memory](https://basicmemory.com) MCP server on
[Uberspace 8](https://uberspace.de) and connect it to OAuth-capable AI clients
(Claude.ai, ChatGPT Developer Mode, and any client that speaks the MCP
authorization spec).

Basic Memory's HTTP transport ships **without authentication** — it is meant to
sit behind your own auth layer. This project provides that layer: a tiny,
single-file **OAuth 2.1 gateway** that you put in front of Basic Memory. It
handles the full authorization-code + PKCE flow with a fixed client ID/secret
and a single password login, then transparently reverse-proxies authenticated
requests (including SSE streaming) to your local Basic Memory instance.

```

## Why this exists

- **Single user, self-hosted, no public cloud IdP.** No Google/GitHub login, no
  Logto/Auth0, no Keycloak, no Docker. Everything runs as plain user services on
  Uberspace.
- **Works with browser-based AI clients.** Claude.ai and ChatGPT require OAuth
  (a static bearer token is not enough); this gateway speaks the OAuth flow they
  expect, using a client ID/secret you define yourself.
- **Minimal.** One Python file, configuration via `.env`, dependencies managed
  with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

## What you get

- OAuth 2.1 authorization-code flow with mandatory **PKCE (S256)**
- Fixed, self-chosen **client ID / client secret** (no dynamic client registration)
- A single **password login** page for the `/authorize` step
- JWT access tokens + rotating refresh tokens
- RFC 8414 / RFC 9728 discovery documents so clients can auto-configure
- Token-validated **reverse proxy** to Basic Memory with SSE/streaming pass-through

---

## Requirements

- An Uberspace 8 account (referred to as user `ubernaut` below — replace with
  your own username throughout)
- SSH access to your Uberspace

`uv` is already installed on Uberspace 8 (at `/usr/bin/uv`), so there is nothing
to install for the Python toolchain.

---

## Installation from scratch

All commands run on your Uberspace shell unless noted otherwise. Replace
`ubernaut` with your actual username everywhere.

### 1. Install and initialize Basic Memory

```bash
uv tool install basic-memory
basic-memory --version     # sanity check
```

Your notes live as Markdown files under `~/basic-memory` by default.

### 2. Get this project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yeah/basic-memory-uberspace.git ~/auth_gateway
cd ~/auth_gateway
uv sync                    # installs gateway dependencies into .venv, writes uv.lock
```

### 3. Create your configuration

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Generate two strong secrets:

```bash
openssl rand -hex 32       # use for CLIENT_SECRET
openssl rand -hex 32       # use for JWT_SECRET
```

Edit `.env` and set:

```ini
BASE_URL=https://ubernaut.uber.space
PORT=8001
UPSTREAM_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000
CLIENT_ID=basic-memory
CLIENT_SECRET=<first openssl value>
JWT_SECRET=<second openssl value>
LOGIN_PASSWORD=<a password you choose>
```

Protect the file (it contains secrets):

```bash
chmod 600 .env
```

> **Important:** `BASE_URL` must exactly match the public URL of your Uberspace,
> without the `/mcp` suffix. If it is wrong, the OAuth discovery breaks for
> browser clients.

### 4. Create the two services

Uberspace 8 uses systemd user services. We run **two**: Basic Memory and the
gateway.

**Basic Memory** — bound to `127.0.0.1`, reachable only by the gateway:

```bash
uberspace service add basicmemory \
  "$HOME/.local/bin/basic-memory mcp --transport streamable-http --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000"
```

> Each Uberspace lives in its own network namespace with its own loopback
> interface, so `127.0.0.1` here is private to your account — other users on the
> same host cannot reach it. Binding Basic Memory to `127.0.0.1` keeps it
> reachable only through the gateway. (The gateway itself must bind `0.0.0.0`,
> see below, because that is what the web backend connects to.)

**The gateway** — runs via uv, binds `0.0.0.0` (required for the web backend).
The `--workdir` is essential: uv needs it to find `pyproject.toml`/`.venv`, and
the gateway needs it to find `.env`. Without it the service fails with
`ModuleNotFoundError`.

```bash
uberspace service add auth_gateway \
  "/usr/bin/uv run python auth_gateway.py" \
  --workdir "$HOME/auth_gateway"
```

Check both services are running:

```bash
systemctl --user status auth_gateway --no-pager   # should be active (running)
systemctl --user status basicmemory --no-pager    # should be active (running)
```

If the gateway logs `ModuleNotFoundError` or `WARNING: ... is not set`, the
working directory is wrong — verify `--workdir` points at the cloned repo and
that `.env` exists there.

### 5. Wire up the web backend

Route **all** traffic on `/` to the gateway. The gateway itself forwards `/mcp`
to Basic Memory after checking the token. Do **not** add a separate `/mcp`
backend pointing at port 8000 — that would bypass authentication.

```bash
uberspace web backend del /          # remove the default Apache backend first
uberspace web backend add / port 8001
uberspace web backend list
```

> The list should show only `/ → 8001`.

## Connecting clients

### Claude.ai

1. Settings → Connectors → **Add custom connector**
2. **URL:** `https://ubernaut.uber.space/mcp`
3. **Advanced settings:**
   - **OAuth Client ID:** the `CLIENT_ID` from your `.env` (e.g. `basic-memory`)
   - **OAuth Client Secret:** the `CLIENT_SECRET` from your `.env`
4. **Connect** → your login page opens in the browser → enter `LOGIN_PASSWORD`.
5. Enable the connector in a chat and try: *"search my notes about …"*

### ChatGPT (Developer Mode)

Settings → Apps & Connectors → Advanced → enable **Developer Mode**, then create
a connector pointing at the same URL with the same client ID/secret. ChatGPT is
stricter about discovery and may expect refresh handling; this gateway issues
refresh tokens, so it should complete the flow.

### Other clients

Clients that accept a static bearer token (e.g. Mistral Le Chat, Gemini CLI,
Cursor) can also use the gateway — point them at `https://ubernaut.uber.space/mcp`
and let them run the OAuth flow, or supply a token issued by the gateway.

## Operating notes

- **Updating dependencies:** `uv add <pkg>` / `uv remove <pkg>` updates
  `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock`. Re-deploy with `uv sync`.
- **Restarts and re-login:** access tokens are verified purely via `JWT_SECRET`,
  so they survive a gateway restart. Refresh tokens are kept in memory and are
  lost on restart — clients re-authenticate the next time a refresh is needed.
  For a single user this is usually fine. To avoid it entirely, persist refresh
  tokens (e.g. in SQLite); not implemented here to keep the gateway minimal.
- **Forcing a fresh OAuth flow** (e.g. for testing): change `JWT_SECRET` and
  restart, or remove and re-add the connector in the client.
- **Logs:** `journalctl --user -u auth_gateway -n 50 --no-pager`

## Security notes

- This is a **single-user** design. The `/authorize` page is protected by one
  password; there is no user management.
- Basic Memory is bound to `127.0.0.1` inside your Uberspace's private network
  namespace and is never reachable from the internet directly. All external
  traffic goes through the gateway, which terminates over HTTPS via Uberspace's
  web backend.
- The gateway implements its own OAuth endpoints. Review the code before relying
  on it for anything beyond personal use.
